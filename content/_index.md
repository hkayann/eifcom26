Foundation models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for various applications. However, their impact on mobile applications has been less investigated. Recent research showcases their ability to achieve unprecedented capabilities in areas such as task automation, hand sign detection, and visual question answering. 

However, their increasing complexity poses significant challenges in terms of sensor modality, diverse sensor environments, model efficiency, interactivity, and user experience. 

The **EIFCom workshop** aims to provide a forum for researchers, developers, and industry partners to share their experiences, present innovative solutions, and discuss the latest advancements in efficient foundation models for mobile applications.

### Topics of Interest

We solicit papers that present preliminary research in broad areas of mobile foundation models, including but not limited to:

- **Efficient Architectures:** On-device training and inference, model compression, quantization, and pruning for mobile budgets.
- **Multimodal Systems:** Integration of diverse sensors (LIDAR, camera, IMU, audio) with foundation models.
- **Interactivity & UX:** Latent-aware response, personalized models, and human-centered AI for mobile devices.
- **Privacy & Security:** Federated learning, on-device privacy-preserving architectures.
- **Applications:** Innovative use cases in task automation, health monitoring, accessibility, and AR/VR.
