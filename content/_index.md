Foundation models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for various applications. However, their impact on mobile applications has been less investigated. Recent research showcases their ability to achieve unprecedented capabilities in areas such as task automation, hand sign detection, and visual question answering. 

However, their increasing complexity poses significant challenges in terms of sensor modality, diverse sensor environments, model efficiency, interactivity, and user experience. 

The **EIFCom workshop** aims to provide a forum for researchers, developers, and industry partners to share their experiences, present innovative solutions, and discuss the latest advancements in efficient foundation models for mobile applications.
